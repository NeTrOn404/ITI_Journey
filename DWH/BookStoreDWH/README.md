Sales Data Warehouse Creation Project

Project Overview:

This project entails the creation of a Sales Data Warehouse (Sales_DWH) from an Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) system called Sales_OLTP. The project involves the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from various dimensions such as dim_customer, dim_salesman, dim_product, and dim_date into the Sales_DWH using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for DWH creation and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for data transfer.

Project Phases:

    Data Extraction:
        Extract data from the Sales_OLTP system.
        Perform initial data profiling and analysis to understand the structure and quality of the data.

    Data Modeling and Schema Design:
        Design the schema for the Sales_DWH, including the creation of dimension tables such as dim_customer, dim_salesman, dim_product, and dim_date.
        Define appropriate relationships between dimension tables and the fact table(s) to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.

    SSMS for DWH Creation:
        Utilize SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create the Sales_DWH database.
        Implement the schema designed in the previous phase, including the creation of tables, indexes, and constraints.

    Data Transformation with SSIS:
        Develop SSIS packages to transform data from the OLTP system into the dimension tables (dim_customer, dim_salesman, dim_product, dim_date) in the Sales_DWH.
        Implement necessary data cleansing, validation, and enrichment processes during the transformation phase to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

    Data Loading:
        Load transformed data into the respective dimension tables within the Sales_DWH using SSIS.
        Monitor and optimize data loading processes to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

    Validation and Testing:
        Perform comprehensive validation and testing of the Sales_DWH to ensure that data integrity, consistency, and quality standards are met.
        Conduct end-to-end testing of data flows from the OLTP system to the Sales_DWH to identify and resolve any issues or discrepancies.

    Documentation and Deployment:
        Document the DWH schema, ETL processes, and data lineage for future reference and maintenance.
        Prepare deployment scripts and procedures for deploying the Sales_DWH solution to production environments.

Technologies Used:

    SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for DWH creation.
    SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL processes.

Project Deliverables:

    Sales_DWH database with dimension tables (dim_customer, dim_salesman, dim_product, dim_date) and fact table(s) representing sales transactions.
    Fully documented schema design, ETL processes, and deployment instructions.
    Validation and testing reports detailing the accuracy and completeness of the Sales_DWH solution.

Conclusion:
The Sales Data Warehouse creation project aims to provide a robust and scalable platform for analyzing sales data from the Sales_OLTP system.
 By leveraging SSMS for DWH creation and SSIS for data transformation, the project ensures the efficient extraction, transformation, and loading of data into the Sales_DWH, enabling organizations to derive valuable insights and make informed business decisions.
